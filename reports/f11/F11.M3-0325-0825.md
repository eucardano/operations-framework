# F11 - 03/2025 - 08/2025 Milestone 3


### Summary

Thanks to the accepted Change Request, we were able to allocate funds directly to community operations and meet our targets for *The Founder Blueprints V1*.

This decision proved to be the right one: removing our dependency on the Country Hub workshops as a main driver for Blueprint input was validated when the final workshop did not deliver the expected output, despite funding opportunities and provided merch.

Marcus continued to lead the Fireside Chats, Pitch Events, and NFTweekend as part of our regular weekly giveaways. He integrated CNFT projects to offer promotional NFTs, boosting growth on both our X profile and Discord channel. Finalizing the Founder Blueprints remained a top priority and was successfully achieved despite a few bumps along the way.

He also partnered ECC with Promo Facie to launch the *Late Night Unicorn* X-Spaces, hosted on Sundays by Davide and the Promo Facie team. Promo Facie is a Cardano-based start-up, deeply rooted in the CNFT ecosystem, amplifying engagement on X through Discord and their APIs.

Our extension beyond the initial timeline gave us additional time to complete tasks, deliver extra value to the community, and stay within budget constraints.

As a team, we remained committed to our proposal, even when the work-reward ratio became less favorable. 


### Constraints

In addition to challenging market conditions, unforeseen tragic events in the private lives of team members prolonged the execution timeline. Nevertheless, we kept our commitment and delivered on the agreed tasks.

# F11 - 08/2025 Final Milestone - Closeout


### Summary


By the end of July 2025, we had already delivered all requested outputs as part of our third milestone.  
This final report summarizes the overall status quo, providing an overview of the total achievements and KPIs to offer the most comprehensible value for the reader.  

We initially started as a team of four but, after proposal submission, continued as a team of two — facing an increased workload to be managed alongside our individual projects and professional commitments.  

This created new challenges in maintaining our delivery pace and extended both our timeline and the costs of sustaining paid services such as X/Twitter’s Blue Checkmark and Zoom subscriptions.  

Despite these unexpected shifts, we delivered all funded outputs and exceeded the initially proposed number of events by more than threefold.  
Marcus (co-founder of Larissa.Health) remained the driving and executing force, with Davide (Inpendent open-source Developer) providing support within his available capacity – proving our shared commitment to strengthening the community of founders in the ecosystem, regardless of our personal constraints.  
Between March 2024 and August 2025, the European Cardano Community (ECC) organized 55 public sessions across Europe, including 26 Fireside Chats, 5 Pitch Fests, and 24 regional X-Spaces — reaching more than 4,900 participants and listeners and featuring over 100 unique Cardano projects and founders.

These events enhanced visibility for pan-European builders as well as projects from Africa, Asia, and the Americas.  
We quietly supported members in their efforts to collaborate with Intersect and Project Catalyst, expanding community reach through localized series in the UK, Germany, Italy, France, and Greece.  

The NFTweekend initiative facilitated 46 on-chain promotions and giveaways, distributing 46 CNFTs and roughly 62 ADA across nearly 40 unique participants.  
Our campaigns served as weekly community touchpoints, increasing visibility for small NFT projects and sustaining consistent ecosystem engagement throughout Fund 11.
At the end of this journey, we returned the remaining CNFTs to the respective projects – with one exception:
> "The Refresh CNFT"-token project created an ECC token specifically for the community. 
> With Refresh's permission it remains in our wallet in case ECC's finds a revival or continuation in the future.     

Our Blueprint for Founders remains open-sourced, including references to our marketing scripts such as NFTweekend, examples of semi-automated social media marketing, and lessons learned from each event format we tested and delivered.   
It captures the accumulated experience of our journey and serves as a foundation for the community to expand upon.  

We never saw ourselves as a project advertiser or influencer initiative.  
Our mission was to be a facilitator, providing the space and resources for our members to connect with each other, the Cardano ecosystem, and beyond.  
In this spirit, we connected real-world and CNFT projects through their founder journeys and explored topics such as legal frameworks, compliance, tokenization, and marketing.  


Much love and take care.  
If you ever need us again, ping us – we've always been just one vote away.  
See you in Catalyst. 
Marcus and Davide  – The ECC team.

If you see something that needs correction or could be explained better go forward and request a change 👀🎉

Head over to **Blockchain & Projects,** and please proceed in the following pattern.

Blockchains and projects should be sorted in alphabetical order.

If your Project is already handling cross-platform then add your project to the ledger you mainly operate on. After that you add only the name in the [cross-platform-projects.md](../blockchains-and-projects/cross-platform-projects.md "mention") and link it to the different ledgers/blockchains using GitBook's links.&#x20;

# Product Development



## TL;DR

Building a product in the Web3 space is not just about having a great idea.
It requires a clear value proposition, technical feasibility, compliance awareness, and community alignment from the start.
Blockchain integration should be purposeful – not added for hype, but to solve a real problem or enable a unique user experience.



## 1. Creating a Product

Even in the blockchain era, classic product development principles apply – the difference lies in the infrastructure and user expectations.

| Step                                | Description                                            | Web3/Blockchain Twist                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Identify a problem worth solving | Talk to your target audience, validate the pain points | Include blockchain-native users and communities in feedback loops |
| 2. Define the value proposition     | Clearly state why your product is better or different  | Highlight trustless, decentralized, or tokenized elements    |
| 3. Prototype & MVP                  | Build a minimal version to test your assumptions       | Use testnets to simulate blockchain functions without real cost |
| 4. Validate with early users        | Gather feedback from a controlled group                | Engage with crypto-communities on Discord, Telegram, or XSpaces |
| 5. Iterate based on feedback        | Improve features and usability                         | Adjust smart contracts or tokenomics based on real-world use |
| 6. Plan for launch & scaling        | Marketing, support, and infrastructure readiness       | Ensure wallet integrations, security audits, and node capacity |



## 2. Leveraging Blockchain

Blockchain can enhance a product’s features in ways traditional databases cannot – but only if these benefits align with the problem you’re solving.

Every on-chain feature adds complexity, requires audits, and could introduce regulatory obligations.


**Key enhancement areas:**

1. **Trustless transactions** – removing intermediaries while guaranteeing verifiable transactions.
2. **Transparent data** – public ledgers can improve auditability for supply chains, donations, or governance.
3. **Ownership & tokenization** – enabling real digital ownership via NFTs or fungible tokens.
4. **Decentralized governance** – letting your community influence development priorities via voting.
5. **Interoperability** – using standards like CIP-68 on Cardano to make your product compatible with others.



> **CIP-68 – On-chain Token Metadata Standard (Datum-anchored)** is an extension and improvement of the **CIP-25** NFT – static metadata – standard
> CIP-68 (Cardano Improvement Proposal No. 68) defines a standardized way to store **mutable and immutable metadata** directly on-chain for native tokens.
>
> - **Immutable metadata**: Data that never changes (e.g., token name, origin, creation date).
> - **Mutable metadata**: Data that can be updated (e.g., current owner attributes, evolving NFT artwork, status in a supply chain).
>
> This is particularly important for product development because it enables richer functionality than static NFTs — for example, a ticket NFT whose seat assignment changes, or a DAO membership token whose role permissions evolve over time.
> See also: **CIP-68 with Reference Scripts** (Reducing transaction size and cost when updating mutable metadata) and **CIP-95** (In-dApp asset metadata querying)





## 3. Classic vs. Blockchain-Integrated Product Development

| Step / Consideration                        | Traditional Approach                            | Blockchain-Integrated Approach                               | Additional Risks / Checks                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Identify the problem                        | Market research, customer interviews            | Include crypto-native communities & DAO feedback             | Niche focus may limit audience size                          |
| Define value proposition                    | Highlight cost savings, convenience, or quality | Highlight decentralization, transparency, tokenization benefits | Risk of over-promising on tech that’s still maturing         |
| Validate if blockchain actually makes sense | Not applicable                                  | Audit use cases: Is blockchain solving a real trust, transparency, or ownership problem? | Blockchain hype without utility can alienate users           |
| Privacy impact assessment                   | GDPR compliance, secure data storage            | On-chain data permanence, DID frameworks, encryption standards | Future algorithms could deanonymize or misuse historical data |
| Prototype & MVP                             | Build minimal core features                     | Include wallet integrations, smart contracts on testnet      | Smart contract bugs or exploits in early versions            |
| User validation                             | Surveys, focus groups                           | A/B test blockchain vs. non-blockchain flows                 | High onboarding friction for non-crypto users                |
| Iteration cycles                            | Feature improvements based on metrics           | Adjust tokenomics, governance, and on-chain logic            | Changes may require costly smart contract migrations         |
| Launch & scaling                            | Increase infrastructure, support                | Ensure node capacity, cross-chain compatibility              | Regulatory scrutiny grows with scale                         |

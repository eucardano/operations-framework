## Common Pitfalls in Blockchain Product Development



1. **Blockchain for the sake of blockchain** – Adding blockchain without a clear value proposition.  
   *Example:* A recipe app stores every cooking step on-chain. This increases costs and complexity with no benefit over a regular database.
2. **Ignoring onboarding friction** – Underestimating how difficult it is for new users to set up wallets, manage private keys, or understand transaction fees.  
   *Example:* A ticketing dApp requires users to install a wallet extension and buy tokens before they can even see available events.
3. **Underestimating privacy implications** – Forgetting that on-chain data is permanent and could be deanonymized in the future.   
   *Example:* Publishing all rental contract details on-chain, even if encrypted, creates a permanent public record that could be decrypted in the future – sensitive personal information should never be placed on-chain.
4. **Smart contract immutability traps** – Deploying contracts without upgrade mechanisms or audits.  
   *Example:* A DeFi protocol with a critical bug locks $5M in user funds permanently because no upgrade path exists.
5. **Tokenomics over-optimization** – Creating overly complex reward systems that confuse users and are hard to maintain.  
   *Example:* A gaming platform with five different tokens for different in-game actions, leading to liquidity issues and user churn.
6. **Regulatory blind spots** – Ignoring tax, AML/KYC, or securities law implications until after launch.  
   *Example:* A European project sells NFTs with profit-sharing features, accidentally triggering securities regulations.
7. **Ignoring off-chain dependencies** – Assuming all real-world actions can be automated on-chain.  
   *Example:* A property NFT marketplace that does not integrate with government land registries, making the NFTs legally meaningless.
8. **Scalability mismatch** – Choosing a chain that cannot handle expected transaction volume or peak usage.  
   *Example:* A popular NFT drop causes gas fees to spike and transactions to fail because the network is congested.
9. **Blockchain/community bias** – Failing to evaluate other blockchains objectively and staying inside an echo chamber.  
   *Example:* A team insists on building on their preferred chain despite another blockchain offering better tooling, lower costs, and higher user adoption for the target market.

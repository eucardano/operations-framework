# Building Networks

In the blockchain space, a strong network can accelerate adoption, improve credibility, and create opportunities that money alone cannot buy.  
Networks are not only about the number of connections but the quality and depth of trust between individuals, teams, and communities.   

In Web3, those relationships often span multiple projects, ecosystems, and governance frameworks, making networking both an art and a strategic skill.  



## TL;DR

Effective networking in Web3 focuses on alignment, collaboration, and transparency.
Instead of chasing sheer follower counts, build relationships that deliver mutual value and foster long-term cooperation.

## 1. Strategies for Building and Leveraging Community Networks

1. **Identify aligned communities**  
   Target spaces that share values, tech stack, or audience.  
   *Example:* A Cardano NFT project collaborating with sustainability-focused DAOs to launch eco-friendly collections.
2. **Cross-project collaborations**  
   Partner on features, campaigns, or events that provide shared visibility.  
   *Example:* Joint hackathons between DeFi and identity projects to bridge liquidity with verified identities.
3. **Leverage in-person and virtual events**  
   Trust builds faster when meeting face-to-face or via live interaction.  
   *Example:* Hosting community dinners at blockchain conferences to deepen existing relationships.
4. **Use governance as a bridge**  
   Involve partners in decision-making to create shared ownership of results.  
   *Example:* Inviting a partner DAO to co-sponsor and co-vote on a public goods initiative.
5. **Maintain transparent communication**   
   Share updates openly in community forums and multi-project channels.  
   *Example:* Publishing monthly collaboration recaps and future plans in Discord.

> **Tip:** Use UTM parameters (or similar) when sharing links so you can track engagement back to its source without compromising privacy.



## 2. Key Principles for Sustainable Networking

1. **Give before you take**  
   Offer value or support without immediate expectations.  
   *Example:* Providing free feedback on a partner’s smart contract audit.
2. **Document collaborations**  
   Keep public records of partnerships and outcomes.  
   *Example:* A shared Notion page or GitHub repo tracking milestones of a cross-project initiative.
3. **Respect cultural differences**  
   Particularly important in global communities.  
   *Example:* Scheduling calls with awareness of different time zones and holidays.
4. **Follow through**  
   Reliability strengthens reputation more than hype.  
   *Example:* Delivering on your part of a partnership before announcing the next one.



## 3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Joining every community without a clear purpose.
2. Over-promising collaboration deliverables to gain short-term goodwill.
3. Treating networking as transactional instead of relational.
4. Ignoring quiet contributors who may have long-term strategic value.



## 4. Network Mapping Template

Use this simple template to visualise your current network, identify gaps, and prioritise relationship-building. 



| Category              | Example Contacts / Communities            | Current Strength (1–5) | Desired Strength (1–5) | Next Action                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Local blockchain hubs | Cardano Berlin Meetup, ETH Munich         | 2                      | 4                      | Attend next event, volunteer as speaker |

> **Tip:** Use tools like GitHub or GitLab Projects (issues) to plan and track your progress. It is The learning curve is less steep than you think. These plaforms are not developers-only – promised.



## 5. Network Expansion Sprint (30 Days)

A focused, time-boxed approach to grow and strengthen your network without losing momentum in core project work.

| Week       | Focus Area                  | Key Actions                                                  | Output                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Week 1** | **Map & Prioritise**        | - Fill in the network mapping template. - Rank contacts/communities by strategic importance. - Identify 3–5 “high-leverage” relationships to deepen. | Prioritised network map with action items.                   |
| **Week 2** | **Engage & Offer Value**    | - Share relevant resources in partner communities. - Comment meaningfully on ecosystem posts. - Send 1–2 personalised “check-in” or intro messages daily. | Visible activity in key spaces, stronger individual ties.    |
| **Week 3** | **Collaborate Lightly**     | - Propose small, low-risk joint activities (co-tweet, retweet, shared space, small bounty). - Offer expertise or time on a micro-project. | At least 2 new collaborative touchpoints.                    |
| **Week 4** | **Consolidate & Publicise** | - Share public recap of collaborations, events, or learnings. - Tag and credit all collaborators. - Set dates for follow-up calls or events. | Public post showcasing network growth, stronger ongoing relationships. |



**Tips for Sprint Success**

- Keep outreach genuine – avoid template spam.
- Track all interactions in a Git-project simple spreadsheet or CRM.
- Use UTM parameters for links to measure which activities bring the most engagement.
- Avoid overcommitting – it’s better to under-promise and over-deliver.

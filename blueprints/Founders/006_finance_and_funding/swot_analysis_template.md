## SWOT Analysis Template

Use this table to assess your project's **internal strengths and weaknesses**, and its **external opportunities and threats**.

- **Internal** factors are within your control (e.g. team, codebase, runway)
- **External** factors come from outside (e.g. market trends, regulation)



| Strengths  (Internal)            | Weaknesses  (Internal)     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| e.g. Experienced team            | e.g. Limited runway        |
| e.g. Strong tech differentiation | e.g. Lack of legal clarity |
|                                  |                            |

| Opportunities  (External)          | Threats  (External)               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| e.g. Growing demand for Web3 IDs   | e.g. Regulatory uncertainty       |
| e.g. Support from Cardano Catalyst | e.g. Competing VC-backed projects |
|                                    |                                   |



### How to Use This

- Keep points short and honest – this is for clarity, not marketing  
- Use bullet points or short phrases  
- Start with 2–3 items per quadrant  
- Update quarterly or before major decisions (funding, partnerships, roadmap changes)  
- Include this in your Business Plan or Pitch Deck to show you're realistic and well-prepared

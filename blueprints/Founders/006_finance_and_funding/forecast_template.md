It is recommended, to also create two additional tables:

- ðŸ“ˆ Best Case Forecast (Base Case + 5 â€“ 20%) 
- ðŸ“‰ Worst Case Forecast (Base Case - 5 â€“ 20%)

Both draw their numbers from the Base Case with an alteration of X%.

- Summarizing individual and gross revenues in `SUM` serve as key performance indicators (KPIs) your financial traction opportunities 
- You can use `Growth Rate` either as a *modifier* for `Products` and `Cohorts`, or calculate it as a *result* in the table
- `Cohorts` accumulate and may need to include `churn`, depending on the complexity of your calculation
- `REVENUE` is the total of `PRODUCT SALES` and `SaaS Cohorts`
- `NET RESULT` is `Profit / Loss (EBIT)` minus `Tax`
- `Profit / Loss (EBIT)` is `REVENUE` minus `COSTS` neglecting any tax differences
- Consider to add a category sum after the price

Below you'll find the table layout to copy in your spreadsheet.

# Funding Options

### TL;DR:

Not every project needs a VC round.  
In Web3, your funding options are broader – from community-backed grants to token launches and NFT pre-sales.  
Each comes with different expectations, risks, and legal implications.



## 1. Traditional vs Web3-native Funding

| Model                 | Source                  | Pros                            | Cons                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Bootstrapping         | Your own money/revenue  | Full control, low risk          | Slower growth, limited resources    |
| Friends & Family      | Informal early backers  | Quick, personal                 | Relationship risk                   |
| Angel Investors / VCs | Private investors       | Large funding, network access   | Equity dilution, long timelines     |
| Public Grants         | Gov programs / EU / R&D | Non-dilutive, milestone-based   | Bureaucratic, slow, competitive     |
| Crowdfunding          | Kickstarter-style       | Early traction, market feedback | Legal unclear in some jurisdictions |
| DAO Grants / Catalyst | Community protocols     | Ecosystem-native, transparent   | Requires community alignment        |
| NFT Launch / Pre-Sale | Product-linked funding  | Fast, audience-driven           | Requires trust & token utility      |
| Token Sale (IDO/ICO)  | On-chain funding        | Scalable, global                | Heavy legal risks (esp. in EU/US)   |

  Raised over $100M while building an identity + token protocol with global reach.  



## 2. Matching Funding to Stage

- **Idea stage:**  
  Bootstrap, DAO micro-grants, public incubator programs

- **Prototype:**  
  NFT-based early access, Catalyst, small angel rounds

- **Launch-ready product:**  
  VC, token round, larger grants or institutional funding

- **Growth:**  
  Ecosystem partnerships, Layer 1 foundations, debt or convertible instruments 

> Tip: Don't chase the biggest check. Choose the model that supports your roadmap without compromising your values or legal clarity.



### Example Mappings

- **Bootstrapper:**  
  A solo founder starts a FOSS wallet tool, funds dev via GitHub sponsors + consulting

- **Catalyst use case:**  
  A DeFi analytics platform applies for Fund 11, receives 35k ADA, builds prototype

- **NFT Launch:**  
  A community drops 1000 NFTs to fund UX research, uses revenue to fund next milestone

- **DAO + VC:**  
  A protocol raises a $2M seed from L1 ecosystem fund and supplements with DAO governance-based treasury expansion



### Real-World Pitfall Example

A small NFT project pre-sold a governance token without registering it.  
It later got delisted from DEX aggregators and flagged by regulators due to perceived investment characteristics and no KYC setup.

→ Solution:  
Define token purpose clearly in a [whitepaper](https://cardanofoundation.org/blog/whitepaper-template-cardano-mica-compliance), apply vesting, and avoid early liquidity if utility is unclear.





## 3. Watchouts for Token-Based Funding

If you're raising funds via a token, understand the implications:

- **Utility must be real**, not just a placeholder
- **Liquidity ≠ value** – tokens can be volatile and manipulated
- **Tax & legal classification** varies by jurisdiction
- Be ready to explain **vesting, rights, governance** and **whitepaper disclosures** (see MiCA)

Token-based funding can work, but only if you're prepared to treat it like a regulated activity.





## 4. Choose what fuels your mission – not just your balance sheet

Many funding sources come with extra value:

- DAO grants offer **ecosystem integration**
- VC firms bring **mentorship and network**
- Public grants provide **legitimacy and structure**
- NFT-based funding builds **early community buy-in**

Funding isn't just about capital – it's about alignment – a strategic fit over Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).

Ask yourself:

- Does this source believe in our values?
- Will they push us toward clarity or just growth?
- What kind of pressure comes with the money?

> Funding is not neutral. Choose the one that matches your pace, jurisdiction, and goals.

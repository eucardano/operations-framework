# Financial Management Basics

### TL;DR:

Strong financial hygiene builds trust – even before your first funding round.  
Set up basic financial tracking, manage wallets and accounts, and prepare for conversations with funders, partners, or grant committees.  
It’s not about fancy spreadsheets – it’s about not losing control.  



## 1. Financial Management Matters

Most projects collapse due to financial fog, not technical failure:

- Plan your runway and avoid surprises  
- Justify your funding needs  
- Make hiring or tooling decisions with confidence  
- Track if your business model is actually working

You don't need complex software to start – a spreadsheet, some discipline, and shared ownership go a long way.  




## 2.Track from Day One

Keep it simple but consistent. Key areas to monitor:

- **Revenues:** Token sales, grants, subscriptions, ISPO rewards, donations  
- **Costs:** Salaries, infrastructure, legal, marketing, platform fees  
- **Runway:** How many months of operations you can sustain at current burn rate  
- **Forecasts:** Base, Best, and Worst case (see our [template](./forecast_template.md))

Include both **crypto** and **fiat** balances.  
Convert periodically using exchange rates and log your conversion rationale (especially for tax).  




## 3. Bank vs Wallet vs Multisig

Most Web3 projects use multiple holding accounts:

| Type     | Purpose                     | Risk/Benefit                          |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Bank     | Salaries, fiat reserves     | Good for accounting and compliance    |
| Wallet   | Flexible spending, bridging | Higher risk, personal key management  |
| Multisig | Treasury and team decisions | Shared access, better control & trust |

Always document **who has access**, and **what the backup plan is**.  
If you run a legally formed corporation then you should have a future-proof plan regarding the crypto wallets.  
This could mean that you may need to transfer wallet ownership when your structure evolves, or if the financial signer needs to be replaced – whether in good or bad faith.




## 4. Reporting Expectations

Even if you're not VC-funded, people expect basic transparency:

- How do you spend funds?
- How much is left?
- What will the next funding round be used for?

Grant programs like Catalyst often require milestone-based release and documentation.
Public dashboards (e.g. on GitHub or Notion) build confidence.  




## 5. When to Involve Advisors

You don’t need a CFO – but you do need someone who asks the right questions.
Consider part-time support or mentoring if:

- You're handling more than one currency (fiat, crypto, token)  
- You plan to raise external capital or issue tokens  
- You receive international funding or need to invoice across borders

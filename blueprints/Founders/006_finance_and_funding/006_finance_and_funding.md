# Finance and Funding

Whether you’re bootstrapping, raising from a DAO, or applying for public funds – finance will shape your project’s reality.  
The following core financial concepts, tools, and templates will help you plan transparently and grow sustainably.  
You don’t need to be an accountant – but you do need to understand  what investors, partners, and regulators will expect.  

Finance is not just accounting – tokenization, trading patterns, and how to communicate your financial model clearly – it’s all part of your story as a founder.

### TL;DR:

Web3 founders have access to new funding tools – but also face new risks and responsibilities.  
You’ll need to combine traditional financial principles with blockchain-native options like token sales, staking, or Catalyst grants.

Build a funding strategy that’s transparent, compliant, and sustainable.



## 1. What Founders Need to Manage

Whether Web2 or Web3, every project eventually needs:

- A basic budget and financial forecast  
- A safe way to receive and manage funds (fiat and crypto)  
- A clear plan for compensation, expenses, and reserves  
- Clarity on tax obligations and reporting needs

In Web3, these basics are often overlooked – but they matter more when things move fast and are (supposedly) “decentralized”.



## 2. Bootstrapping vs External Funding

Every option has trade-offs:

### Bootstrapping  
- Control stays with the core team  
- You grow slower, but with less risk  
- Requires high commitment and a lean MVP strategy

### External Funding  
- Accelerates product development and growth  
- Comes with expectations, oversight, and dilution (or token pressure)  
- Includes angel investors, VCs, grants, and community pre-sales

Tip: Don’t fundraise because it’s trendy. Fundraise because you’re ready.



## 3. Web3-Native Funding Paths

Web3 unlocks unique models:

- **Token pre-sales or airdrops**  
  Early access to tokens in exchange for stablecoins, fiat, or future support  
  Often triggers regulatory scrutiny (MiCA, securities law)

- **NFT sales**  
  Used as access passes, supporter badges, or early utility  
  Great for community – but hard to scale without real value

- **Staking-based funding (ISPOs, treasury delegation)**  
  Community delegates to your pool → you earn staking rewards  
  Non-dilutive, but requires trust and communication

- **Cardano Catalyst**  
  A decentralized grant platform funded through protocol treasury  
  Requires a clear proposal and community engagement



## 4. Handling Funds Responsibly

Some early rules of thumb:

- Separate project wallets from personal funds  
- Document every transaction (yes, even in crypto)  
- Convert some portion of funds to stable reserves if needed  
- Don’t hold large reserves in speculative assets  
- Build transparency dashboards if community funds are involved

> Tip: If you can’t explain how you handle funds, you probably shouldn’t be handling them.



## 5. Building a Funding Narrative

Investors (including your community) want to understand:

- What are you building?  
- How will it make money or deliver value?  
- Why now – and why on this chain?  
- How much do you need – and what for?  
- What’s the roadmap and timeline for usage?

Even grants and DAO voters want to see financial clarity.

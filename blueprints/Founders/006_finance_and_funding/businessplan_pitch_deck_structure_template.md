## Business Plan & Pitch Deck Structure

Use this as a modular framework.  
Each point corresponds to 1–2 paragraphs (Business Plan) or 1 Slide (Pitch Deck).  
Adapt length to your audience.



### TL;DR: Business Plan vs Pitch Deck

**Business Plan**  
A detailed document (8–15 pages) that explains your project, vision, structure, and financials in depth.  
→ Used for grant applications, investor due diligence, incubator programs, or internal planning.  
→ Focus on logic, clarity, and risk awareness – not on design.  
→ Optional: Include templates, appendices, legal structure, token model.

**Pitch Deck**  
A visual presentation (10–12 slides) for meetings, events, or early-stage investor outreach.  
→ Used to quickly tell your story, highlight traction, and spark interest.  
→ Focus on clarity, story flow, and visuals – you can always share your business plan after.  
→ Keep it short, confident, and well-timed (~3 minutes to present without Q&A).

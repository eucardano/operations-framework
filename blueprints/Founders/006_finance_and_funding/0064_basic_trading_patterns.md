# Basic Trading Patterns

### TL;DR:

Crypto isn’t just for holding – it’s also meant for paying.  
But when you’re paying people in volatile tokens, timing matters.  
Understanding basic trading patterns helps founders navigate real-world scenarios like off-ramping, vesting, or DAO payments.



## 1. Payments in a Volatile Market

Most crypto-native teams pay contributors, freelancers, or vendors using tokens.  
This means you’re not just building – you’re also managing volatility.

Understanding patterns helps you:

- Avoid cashing out during weak market phases
- Time major treasury swaps or stablecoin conversions
- Anticipate sell pressure during token unlocks or after grants

You don’t need to become a trader – but pattern awareness helps you stay one step ahead.



## 2. Classic Chart Patterns

Trading patterns are recurring formations that often signal future market moves.  
They reflect human behavior: greed, fear, and consolidation.

Here are some common patterns every founder should recognize:

| Pattern                      | What It Tells You                     | Learn More / Visual                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Head and Shoulders**       | Bearish reversal after an uptrend     | [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/head-shoulders.asp) |
| **Inverse Head & Shoulders** | Bullish reversal after a downtrend    | [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inverseheadandshoulders.asp) |
| **Double Top / Bottom**      | Tests of resistance or support levels | [Double Top](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/doubletop.asp) |
| **Bull Flag / Bear Flag**    | Brief pause before trend continues    | [Bull Flag](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bull-flag.asp) |

> Tip: The most reliable patterns for beginners are **(Inverse) Head & Shoulders** due to their clear structure and broad use.



## 3. Example Use Cases for Founders

- **Your DAO wants to fund a developer grant:**  
  The treasury holds 150,000 ADA. If charts show a head & shoulders pattern, consider delaying disbursement or converting early.

- **Your protocol just received a Catalyst fund payout:**  
  Don’t market sell all tokens at once. Look for accumulation or flag patterns before converting into operational stablecoins.

- **You’re preparing for an exchange listing:**  
  Anticipate speculative spikes and use distribution patterns to inform vesting strategy or incentive unlocks.

## 5. Patterns Don’t Predict – They Suggest

No pattern is magic. But many are **self-fulfilling** – because large traders act on them.  
Combine pattern signals with:

- Volume changes  
- News flow or protocol updates  
- Vesting or unlock schedules  
- Treasury and runway planning



## 6. Pattern literacy = payment reliability

If you're building in Web3, you're holding volatile assets.  
Use pattern literacy not to time the top, but to **make better treasury decisions**.   
It protects your team, your contributors, and your roadmap.

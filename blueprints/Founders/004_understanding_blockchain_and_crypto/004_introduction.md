# Real-World Applications of Blockchain

In this chapter we learn where blockchain is actually used – and what it’s good for.  
Instead of technical specs or visions of the future, this section focuses on real-world problems and working solutions.

From identity and logistics to governance, and memes, this chapter shows how blockchain can provide trust, transparency, and decentralization in practical contexts.

There is also a short excursion to rugpulls.

# Basic Legal Considerations

### TL;DR:

Most founders underestimate how early legal questions come up.  
You don’t need to solve everything on day one – but you should make early decisions visible, reversible, and legally clean.



## 1. Don’t Wait Too Long to Create a Legal Entity

Many projects start informally – and that’s fine.  
But as soon as you:

- Accept payments or investments  
- Issue tokens or NFTs  
- Hire contributors or contractors  
- Store or process personal data  

…you are creating legal exposure.  
Forming a simple capital entity can help separate personal and project liability.



## 2. Web3 ≠ Legal Vacuum

Even if you're working with open source tools or global communities, your actions still fall under national law.

Examples:

- Running a DAO treasury from your wallet may trigger financial services law  
- Distributing tokens may be seen as offering investment products  
- Collecting wallet addresses and IPs may count as handling personal data

You’re not exempt just because it’s decentralized – and regulators are catching up fast.



## 3. Legal ≠ Bureaucracy

Legal isn’t just a compliance hurdle.  
It’s a way to:

- Align your team and define responsibilities  
- Clarify rights and expectations with your community  
- Protect your contributors and early supporters  
- Prevent expensive conflicts down the road

Good legal foundations are like good GitHub documentation:  
They help others contribute with confidence.



## 4. Tools You Should Set Up Early

Even small projects benefit from:

- A clean founder agreement or token allocation document  
- A contributor license agreement (CLA) if you publish open source  
- A basic privacy policy (especially in the EU) – make sure it is on your website together with your imprint 
- A clear Terms of Use, even if short and friendly  
- A wallet policy – who controls which funds, and how?

These documents don’t have to be perfect – but they should exist.



## 5. Legal Is Not a One-Off

- Your legal setup evolves with your project.

  - Launching a community token? You may need a different structure than for selling services.  
  - Raising funds? That’s a whole new layer.  
  - Working across borders? You may face multiple jurisdictions.

  The earlier you write things down, the easier it is to adapt later.

  **Legal is not a blocker. It's a form of future-proofing.**

# Project Checklist and Common Mistakes

### TL;DR:

A Web3 projects fail is less probably due to tech – but because of unclear expectations, missing documentation, or legal blind spots.  
Use this checklist to stay ahead – and learn from others' missteps before you make them yourself.



## Project Kickoff Checklist

Before you ship your first MVP or accept funds, make sure these essentials are covered:



### Team & Roles

- [ ] Who are the core contributors, and how are decisions made?  
- [ ] Are roles documented (technical, legal, community, treasury)?  
- [ ] Is there a clear escalation path for disputes or disagreements?

### Legal & Structure

- [ ] Is there a legal entity in place (or planned soon)?  
- [ ] Have responsibilities and ownership been clarified (IP, tokens, equity)?  
- [ ] Are contributor agreements, NDAs, or vesting schedules defined?  
- [ ] Have you evaluated if your setup triggers licensing obligations (e.g. MiCA, KYC)?

### Treasury & Wallets

- [ ] Who controls which wallets?  
- [ ] Is there a multi-sig in place for shared funds?  
- [ ] Is wallet access documented and transferable if someone leaves?  
- [ ] Are funds held on behalf of others (e.g. staking, ISPO, DAO treasury)?

### Terms & Transparency

- [ ] Do you have a basic Terms of Use and Privacy Policy?  
- [ ] Are you transparent about risk, governance, and rewards?  
- [ ] Have you documented how your project intends to stay compliant?  
- [ ] Is your whitepaper clear on token rights, utility, and economics?

### Tech Foundations

- [ ] Is your GitHub public or ready to be?  
- [ ] Do you have a proper license attached to your codebase?  
- [ ] Are infrastructure and backups secured and owned by the team (not individuals)?  
- [ ] Are dependencies well maintained and security reviewed?







## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Thinking legal comes later:**  
  Even informal activity may trigger regulation – especially with tokens, treasuries, or user data.

- **Calling it a DAO too early:**  
  Without structure, your DAO may just be a loose business association – with unlimited liability.

- **No wallet policies:**  
  Personal wallets used for project funds cause chaos during disputes or exits.

- **Confusing token ownership and project ownership:**  
  Just because someone holds tokens doesn’t mean they own IP, branding, or control.

- **No fallback plan:**  
  If a founder gets sick or leaves, what happens? Who has access to accounts, domains, or repos?

- **Delaying public communication:**  
  Transparency isn’t just good ethics – it’s part of building trust and legal clarity.

- **Overselling token utility:**  
  Marketing that sounds like investment advice may trigger MiCA or securities law.





## Every successful project has its own learning curve

This list won’t protect you from every mistake – but it will help you avoid the obvious ones.  
And if you’re in doubt, document your intent and talk to someone experienced.

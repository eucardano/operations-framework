# Company Structure Nuances

### TL;DR:

Choosing a legal structure isn’t just a formality.  
It defines how you operate, raise funds, sign contracts, pay contributors – and how liability is handled.  
Web3 projects often need hybrid models that balance decentralization with legal clarity.

## 1. Legal Structures – The Usual Choices

There is currently an attempt to establish an EU-inc.   
The goal is to streamline the taxation, investments and processes for companies across Europe.  

Until then, you will find some common forms of capital companies/corporate entities across Europe and internationally:

- **UG / GmbH** (Germany)  
- **SARL / SAS** (France / Luxembourg)  
- **SE** (Spain)
- **BV** (Netherlands)  
- **LTD** (UK / Cyprus / Malta)  
- **GmbH** / AG (Switzerland / Austria)  
- **OU** (Estonia)  

Each comes with different capital requirements, reporting rules, and risk exposure.
The commonality is protection of the founders from financial liabilities.
But be aware you won't be shielded from obvious or malicious wrong-doing.

If you’re just getting started, choose a low-friction form (like UG or LTD) to begin operating, sign contracts, or issue invoices.  
However, be aware that you'll likely have to pay for a legal representative if you start in .  



## 2. One Company, or More?

Many projects use two or more entities to separate:

- **Operations vs. IP ownership**  
- **Commercial activity vs. protocol governance**  
- **European vs. non-EU scope**

Example: One corporate entity for product development, one DAO wrapper – in form of a capital company or foundation – abroad for treasury and governance.

This adds complexity, but also flexibility – especially for scaling or fundraising later.

### Example structures from real-world projects:

- **Gnosis / Safe:**  
  Gnosis Ltd (DE) handled core development, while the SafeDAO manages the treasury and protocol decisions.

- **Aragon:**  
  Operated with a Swiss foundation for IP holding and a DAO for governance, while contributors were paid through third-party service providers.

- **Zerion:**  
  A UK LTD for platform development, paired with a Cayman entity for investor coordination and token distribution.

- **Typical setup in early-stage projects:**  
  One capital company handles all formalities. A DAO or multi-sig is created later for treasury governance.

### A practical split could look like this:

- **Product Company:**  
  Handles payroll, accounting, customer support, legal filings, and vendor contracts

- **DAO / Multi-sig:**  
  Oversees treasury decisions, funds proposals, and supports community tooling

- **Shared governance protocol:**  
  Defines how both sides communicate and veto powers, if applicable



## 3. DAO Is Not a Legal Form (Yet)

DAOs can govern protocols or treasuries – but they are not recognized as legal entities in most jurisdictions.

That means:

- People signing off-chain contracts are still personally liable  
- On-chain votes don’t replace legal authority unless mirrored in a formal structure  
- Regulatory responsibility may fall back to identifiable operators

Some jurisdictions (e.g. Wyoming, Marshall Islands) offer DAO-LLC hybrids – but they rarely match EU needs.  
Instead, think of the DAO as a governance layer on top of a legally grounded base.

In most cases, DAOs are handled through a separate legal entity.  
This can be a foundation (e.g. Swiss Stiftung) or a corporate entity such as a GmbH, Ltd, or BV.
If no legal wrapper is formed, the DAO may be treated as an informal civil-law partnership – sometimes without the founders even realizing it.

Operating a DAO without a formal wrapper may lead to:

- Personal liability of contributors or multisig signers  
- Tax obligations falling back to individuals  
- Legal uncertainty in fundraising, token issuance, or service contracts

Whenever your DAO holds funds, signs deals, or pays contributors, you should treat it like a legal actor – and give it a suitable wrapper.



## 4. Hybrid Structures: Mixing Web2 and Web3

For many projects, the best approach is pragmatic:

- A company to handle staff, accounting, and compliance  
- A DAO or governance layer to handle votes, treasury, or roadmap input  
- Clear agreements between both sides

Make sure the DAO doesn’t rely on vague promises – formalize how decisions are made and who signs what.



## 5. Things to Document Early

Even small teams benefit from early alignment:

- Who owns what? (IP, token supply, domains)  
- Who controls which wallets?  
- What happens if someone leaves or disagrees?  
- Are token allocations tied to contributions, time, or roles?

You don’t need a 40-page shareholder agreement – but you do need clarity and signatures.



## Good structure isn’t centralization. It’s coordination.

Many Web3 projects break down not because of tech – but because roles, incentives, or expectations were never clearly written down.  
And founders who plan for success should build foundations that scale with them.

> Tip: Founders from Germany often start with a UG and switch to a GmbH after fundraising.
> In cross-border setups, a UK Ltd or Estonian OU can reduce early friction – but may require a fiscal representative.

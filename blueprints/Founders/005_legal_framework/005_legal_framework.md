# Legal Framework

### TL;DR:

You don’t need to be a lawyer – but you do need legal basics and need to understand your limitations.  
Forming a company, issuing tokens, handling funds, or collecting data all come with legal responsibilities.  
Web3 doesn’t live outside the law – it’s just not evenly regulated yet.

## 1. Legal Matters – Even in Web3  
Many Web3 founders start with code, community, or vision.  
But once you accept funds, launch a token, or process user data – you’re dealing with law.

Clear legal structure builds trust with users, partners, and regulators.  
It also protects you personally and reduces the risk of costly misunderstandings later.  

An often neglected benefit is, that legal forces you to add improvements to your product and structure that go along with the ethos of web3: Protection of users, data, and funds. 

Think of legal clarity as a scalability tool.  
It doesn’t kill innovation – it lets you sustain it.



## 2. Common Legal Touchpoints for Founders  
Legal questions show up earlier than many expect.  
Here are the most common areas where blockchain projects intersect with the law:

- **Incorporation and liability:**  
  Setting up a legal entity gives you structure and protects your personal assets.

- **Decentralization:**
  You are not decentralized until you hit a critical mass of contributors.   
  Until then you are most likely a regular group of business owners with all it's benefits and responsibilities.
  
- **Token issuance and classification:**  
  Utility, payment, security, governance – the type of your token matters.  
  In the EU, classification will be guided by MiCA and national regulators.

- **Custody and fund access:**  
  If your platform holds tokens for others (even temporarily), you may trigger licensing requirements.  
  Being a financial agent comes with a few very strict obligations.
  
- **Data privacy (e.g., GDPR):**  
  Storing or processing personal data comes with strict rules in the EU and beyond.  
  Blockchain complicates this due to immutability – off-chain architecture is often needed.  
  GDPR also touches on use cases of AI, governed through the AI-Act.
  
- **KYC and AML obligations:**  
  Some use cases require customer identity verification or monitoring of suspicious activity.

- **Terms of service and IP:**  
  Clearly define what users can expect, and who owns what.  
  If you use open source components, respect their licenses.



## 3. MiCA and the Rise of EU Regulation  
The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is the EU’s attempt to bring clarity to the crypto space.  
It aims to protect consumers and support innovation through legal certainty.

For founders, MiCA introduces specific categories like:

- **Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs)**  
- **E-Money Tokens (EMTs)**  
- **Utility Tokens**

It also defines obligations for crypto service providers – including whitepaper rules, capital requirements, and transparency standards.

MiCA started to be enforced in stages from 2024.  
Even if you're outside the EU, working with European users or partners may bring it into scope.

## 4. Structuring Your Project Legally  
There is no one-size-fits-all structure – but some questions help:

- Will you form a traditional company, a DAO, or both?
- Do you need local presence, or can you operate cross-border?
- Who is responsible for funds, treasury, or compliance?

Typical setups include:

- **Company-first:** a UG, GmbH, SARL or Ltd. that operates the project
- **DAO-layered:** community governance on top, with limited legal wrappers
- **Hybrid:** the company provides services, while the DAO handles treasury or votes

If unsure, start with a lean legal shell – but think ahead.



## 5. Know Your Limits – and Your Advisors  
You don’t need to master law, but you should know when to ask for help.  
A good advisor won’t just file documents – they’ll ask the right questions before you commit to a structure.

Keep written records of:

- Roles and responsibilities  
- Token allocations and vesting  
- Licensing or IP usage  
- Disclaimers and risk notices  
- Contributor agreements or code licenses

These may not feel urgent now – but you’ll be glad they exist when your project gains traction.

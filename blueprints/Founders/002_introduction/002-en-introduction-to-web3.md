# Introduction

The evolution from Web2 to Web3 represents a transformative shift in how online platforms are built and operated.  
Unlike Web2, which is characterized by centralized control, proprietary platforms, and restricted data management, Web3 aims for decentralized ecosystems empowered by blockchain technology.  

Although Web3 is still a work in progress in its early stages, its promise lies in the rapid evolution of open source projectsâ€”where a mix of public and private source code drives innovation and resilience.  

This doesn't say that for-profit companies won't exist, only that their paradigms may shift to embrace parts of the Web3 philosophy.  


### 1. **What is Web3 and How is it Different from Web2?**  

   Web3 represents a move away from centralized models, emphasizing user control, decentralization, and trustless interactions.   
   Despite its nascent state, Web3 is evolving quickly, with continuous advancements and community-driven improvements shaping its future.  
   The rapid growth of open source initiatives in both Web2 and Web3 has created a dynamic environment where innovation coexists with a blend of public and private codebases.  
   There is a difference between blockchain and crypto which we will dive into in [Understanding Blockchain and Crypto](004_understanding_blockchain_and_crypto/)
   

   
   Community-driven initiatives are at the heart of blockchain innovation, promoting transparency and collaboration.  
   Open source development not only accelerates technological progress but also ensures that the ecosystem remains adaptable and secure.  
   By embracing open source principles, the blockchain community builds trust and enables diverse contributions from developers around the globe.  
   Like traditional networks, different blockchains are serving special purposes or at least favoured by different interest groups.  
   It might be worth to evaluate which blockchain-ecosystem fits your need best instead of looking for a one-size-fits-all approach.  


### 3. **Companies in Web3**  
   In this emerging landscape, companies are reinventing traditional business models by incorporating decentralized governance and community engagement into their core strategies.  
   
   These organizations leverage both conventional and innovative practices to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by - and unique to - Web3.  
   

### 4. **Leveraging Collective Knowledge for Effective Decision-Making**  
   One of the most significant aspects of the Web3 ecosystem is its blend of collective wisdom and the challenges of tribalism.   
   This diversity, paired with siloed communities can be overwhelming and fuelling at the same time.
   However, by drawing insights from a wide range of - literal - stakeholders, founders can make informed decisions that drive sustainable growth and foster innovation by a human-centered-design backed by predictable, transparent technology.

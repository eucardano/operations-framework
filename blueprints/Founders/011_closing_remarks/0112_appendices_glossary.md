# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Blueprints.  
It is intended as a quick reference for founders, contributors, and readers who may be new to certain technical, legal, or community concepts.

---

## A

**ADA**  
The native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain, used for transaction fees, staking, and governance.

**Address**  
A unique string that identifies a wallet or smart contract on the blockchain. Similar to an IBAN in banking.

**Ambassador**  
A community member who represents a project or ecosystem in a regional or thematic context, often bridging local and global communities.

---

## B

**Blockchain**  
A distributed ledger system where transactions are grouped into blocks, cryptographically secured, and linked in chronological order.

**Blueprint**  
In this context, a structured set of guidelines, processes, and examples to help founders and teams build sustainable projects.

**Burn**  
The permanent removal of tokens from circulation by sending them to an unspendable address.

---

## C

**Catalyst (Project Catalyst)**  
Cardano’s community-driven innovation fund, where projects are proposed, voted on, and funded by ADA holders.

**CEX (Centralized Exchange)**  
A cryptocurrency exchange operated by a central authority or company that manages user accounts, holds custody of funds, and facilitates trading between cryptocurrencies or between crypto and fiat.  
Users trade through the exchange’s internal ledger rather than directly on a blockchain.  
Example: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken.

**Cold Wallet**  
A cryptocurrency wallet that is kept offline, providing a high level of security by isolating private keys from internet-based threats.  
Cold wallets are generally used for long-term storage of significant funds.  
Examples: Hardware wallets, paper wallets, or air-gapped computers.

**Community Hub**  
A local or regional initiative that organizes events, meetups, and collaborative activities to strengthen ecosystem engagement.

**Consensus Mechanism**  
The protocol used to agree on the validity of transactions and the state of the blockchain. Cardano uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

---

## D

**DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**  
A community-led organization governed by smart contracts and token-holder voting, rather than a central authority.

**Delegation**  
The act of assigning your ADA stake to a stake pool to help secure the network and earn rewards.

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**  
Financial services built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional intermediaries.  

**DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**  
A peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platform that operates without a central authority, using smart contracts to execute trades directly on a blockchain.  
Users retain custody of their funds and interact through their wallets.  
Example: Uniswap (Ethereum), Minswap (Cardano), Raydium (Solana).

**Decentralized Identifier (DID)**  
A globally unique, verifiable digital identifier that is created and owned by the subject (person, organization, device) rather than issued by a central authority.  
DIDs enable secure, privacy-preserving interactions in decentralized systems and are often recorded on a blockchain or distributed ledger.

**Decentralized Identifier Document (DID Document)**  
A JSON or JSON-LD file that contains the public keys, authentication methods, and service endpoints associated with a Decentralized Identifier (DID).  
The DID Document allows entities to verify control over the DID and defines how secure interactions (e.g., authentication, encryption) can occur between parties.

**DRep (Delegated Representative)**  
An elected or recognized individual or entity within a blockchain governance system to whom token holders can delegate their voting power.  
DReps review proposals, participate in decision-making processes, and vote on behalf of the delegators.  
Example: In Cardano’s Voltaire governance framework, ADA holders can delegate their voting rights to a DRep who represents their interests in Project Catalyst proposals.


---

## E

**Ecosystem**  
The network of stakeholders, tools, infrastructure, and activities that make up a blockchain community.

**Epoch**  
A fixed period in Cardano (currently 5 days) used for stake delegation cycles and reward distribution.

---

## F

**Faucet**  
A service that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrency for free, often for testing or onboarding purposes.

**Fork**  
A change to the blockchain protocol that may result in two separate versions of the chain (soft fork or hard fork).

---

## G

**Governance**  
The processes, structures, and rules that define how decisions are made within a blockchain network or decentralized organization.  
Governance can be on-chain (executed via smart contracts and blockchain voting) or off-chain (coordinated through community discussions, forums, and working groups).  

- **On-chain governance**  
  Decisions are made and executed directly through blockchain protocols, with transparent and verifiable voting.  
  Example: Protocol parameter changes voted on via smart contracts.

- **Off-chain governance**  
  Decision-making occurs outside of the blockchain, often through community consensus, social signaling, or foundation-led processes, which are later implemented on-chain.

- **Hybrid governance**  
  Combines both on-chain mechanisms for execution and off-chain discussions for deliberation and consensus building.

---

## H

**Hot Wallet**  
A cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet, allowing quick and convenient access to funds for sending and receiving transactions.  
While hot wallets are practical for frequent use, they are more vulnerable to hacking and phishing compared to offline (cold) storage.  
Examples: Mobile wallets, browser-based wallets, or exchange-hosted wallets.

---

## I

**Incentives**  
Rewards or benefits given to participants for taking desired actions, such as staking, contributing code, or organizing events.

**ISPO (Initial Stake Pool Offering)**  
A fundraising mechanism where users delegate ADA to a specific pool and receive project tokens instead of ADA rewards.

---

## L

**Liquidity**  
The ease with which an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price significantly.

**Local Hub**  
See **Community Hub** — a regional anchor point for grassroots activities.

---

## M

**Metadata**  
Additional information stored alongside a blockchain transaction, often used for labeling payments or recording agreements.

---

## N

**NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**  
A unique digital asset recorded on the blockchain, often used for art, collectibles, or proof-of-participation.

---

## P

**Private Key**  
A cryptographic key that grants control over the funds in a blockchain address. Must be kept secret.

**Pointer**  
A reference or indicator to another piece of data, object, or location, rather than storing the data itself.  
In blockchain contexts, a pointer can refer to an on-chain reference that links to off-chain data (e.g., an IPFS hash) or to an index position in a dataset, allowing efficient access without duplicating information.

- **On-chain pointer**  
  A reference stored directly on the blockchain that points to another location, either on-chain or off-chain.  
  Example: A transaction metadata field containing an IPFS CID for a document.

- **Off-chain pointer**  
  A reference stored outside the blockchain that links to on-chain data or to another off-chain resource.  
  Example: An API database entry storing the transaction hash of a related blockchain record.

**Proof-of-Authority (PoA)**  
A small set of pre-approved validators (by identity) produce blocks.  
Pros: Extremely fast, low resource usage.  
Cons: High centralization and trust in known validators.  
Example: VeChain.

**Proof-of-Burn (PoB)**  
Participants prove commitment by destroying (burning) a portion of cryptocurrency, granting them the right to mine or validate.  
Pros: Discourages spam, reduces supply.  
Cons: Permanently destroys value.  
Example: Counterparty.

**Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) / Proof-of-Space (PoSpace)**  
Participants allocate disk space to store cryptographic data used for block validation.  
Pros: More energy-efficient than PoW.  
Cons: Requires large storage capacity.  
Example: Chia.

**Proof-of-Elapsed Time (PoET)**  
A consensus method where participants wait a random amount of time before producing a block, verified by trusted hardware.  
Pros: Low energy usage.  
Cons: Relies on trusted hardware, introducing possible centralization.  
Example: Hyperledger Sawtooth.

**Proof-of-History (PoH)**  
A cryptographic timestamping method used to prove that events occurred in a specific sequence without relying on traditional block intervals.  
Pros: Enables high throughput.  
Cons: Usually combined with another consensus mechanism.  
Example: Solana.

**Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**  
Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake.  
Pros: Energy-efficient, faster than PoW.  
Cons: Can favor wealthy participants.  
Example: Cardano, Ethereum (post-Merge).

- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**  
Token holders vote for a small number of delegates who produce blocks on their behalf.  
Pros: Very fast, scalable.  
Cons: Higher centralization risk.  
Example: EOS, TRON.

**Proof-of-Work (PoW)**  
A consensus mechanism where miners solve computational puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.  
Pros: High security, proven in production.  
Cons: Very energy-intensive and slower compared to newer mechanisms.  
Example: Bitcoin.

**Public Key**  
A cryptographic key derived from a private key, used to receive transactions.

---

## R

**Redeemer**  
In the Extended UTXO (eUTXO) model, used by Cardano, a redeemer is a piece of data provided when spending a script-locked output.  
It works alongside the datum to give the smart contract the necessary context to validate the transaction.  
Think of the datum as *what* is stored with the UTXO, and the redeemer as *how* or *why* the funds are being spent.  
Example: In a time-locked contract, the redeemer might specify the withdrawal action and the signature of the claimant.  

**Reputation**  
A trust metric assigned to participants based on their past behavior, contributions, or verification status.  
Often used in DAOs, marketplaces, and decentralized identity systems to determine voting power, access rights, or credibility.  
Pros: Encourages good behavior and long-term engagement.  
Cons: Can be gamed if poorly designed.  
Example: Stack Overflow–style DAO reputation, BrightID, Proof-of-Humanity.

---

## S

**Seed phrase**  
A sequence of words (typically 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24) generated by a cryptocurrency wallet that encodes the private keys needed to access and control blockchain funds.  
It is a human-readable backup that can restore an entire wallet, including all associated addresses and assets.  
Losing the seed phrase means losing access to the wallet; anyone who obtains it can spend the funds.  
Example: A 24-word BIP39 seed phrase generated when creating a new Cardano wallet in Daedalus or Eternl.

**Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**  
A digital identity model where individuals fully own and control their personal data, credentials, and identifiers.  
SSI allows selective disclosure of information without relying on a central identity provider, often using technologies such as DIDs, verifiable credentials, and cryptographic proofs.

**Smart Contract**  
Self-executing code deployed on a blockchain that runs when predefined conditions are met.

**Stake Pool**  
A node in the Cardano network that validates transactions and produces blocks. Users can delegate their ADA to stake pools.

**Staking**  
Locking up cryptocurrency in a blockchain network to support operations (like block production) and earn rewards.

---

## T

**Tokenomics**  
The design of a cryptocurrency’s economic model, including supply, distribution, incentives, and utility.

**Treasury**  
Funds held by a blockchain protocol or organization, typically used for development, grants, and ecosystem growth.

---

## W

**Wallet**  
A software or hardware tool that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.

**Web3**  
The next generation of the internet, built on decentralized protocols and blockchains, emphasizing user ownership and control.

**Witness**  
In some blockchain protocols, a witness is a node responsible for validating transactions, producing blocks, or confirming network events.    
In governance contexts, witnesses may also attest to off-chain facts (or cross-chain events) for smart contracts.   
Example: Witness nodes in Graphene-based chains like Steem, oracles acting as witnesses in cross-chain bridges.

---

## Z

**Zero-Knowledge (ZK)**  
A cryptographic concept that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

**Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK Proof)**  
A method within zero-knowledge cryptography where a prover demonstrates the truth of a claim without disclosing the underlying data.  
ZK proofs are widely used in privacy-preserving blockchain transactions and identity verification.

**Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARK)**  
A type of zero-knowledge proof that is both succinct (small in size and fast to verify) and non-interactive (requires no back-and-forth communication between prover and verifier).  
ZK-SNARKs are commonly used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and scalability solutions.

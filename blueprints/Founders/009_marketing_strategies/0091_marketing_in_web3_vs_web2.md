# Marketing in Web3 vs Web2



While many core principles of marketing still apply in Web3, the **context, audience, and tools** are fundamentally different.
In Web2, brands control their message, channels, and customer relationship. In Web3, communities **co-own the brand narrative**, every move can be verified on-chain, and even small missteps can lead to immediate public backlash.

For founders transitioning from Web2 to Web3, understanding these differences is key to **avoiding costly mistakes** and **building genuine trust** in a decentralized ecosystem.

## TLD;DR: 

Your audience may hold tokens, vote on your roadmap, and scrutinize your every move on-chain.
Trust, transparency, and community engagement are not just buzzwords – they are **core to survival**.



## Key Differences

| Aspect                  | Web2 Marketing                                               | Web3 Marketing                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Audience**            | Consumers or businesses, usually passive recipients of marketing messages | Token holders, DAO members, and community contributors actively influencing the project |
| **Communication style** | Top-down, brand-controlled                                   | Two-way, transparent, often community-driven                 |
| **Channels**            | Websites, ads, email campaigns, social media                 | Discord, Telegram, X (Twitter), GitHub, governance portals, blockchain explorers |
| **Trust building**      | Reputation, customer experience, influencer endorsements     | Public proof-of-work (deliverables), verifiable on-chain actions, open-source contributions |
| **Brand loyalty**       | Based on satisfaction and habit                              | Based on governance inclusion, fairness of tokenomics, and shared community values |
| **Feedback cycles**     | Periodic surveys, market research reports                    | Continuous, real-time feedback in open forums and governance votes |
| **Metrics**             | Click-through rates, conversions, lead generation            | On-chain participation rates, voting engagement, wallet retention |
| **Risk perception**     | Product issues can harm brand image                          | Token price drops, governance drama, or hacks can instantly damage both reputation and asset value |



## Bridging Strategies for Founders

1. **Engage in the right channels early**
   - If your audience is crypto-native, spend more time on Discord/XSpaces than on LinkedIn ads.
   - For mixed audiences, build a dual-channel strategy to keep Web2 users informed without alienating Web3 natives.
2. **Prove before you promise**
   - Deliver working prototypes, testnet demos, or governance participation before making bold public claims.
3. **Adopt radical transparency**
   - Publish treasury reports, milestone updates, and even mistakes openly.
   - If you receive funding (e.g., Catalyst), share TX hashes or public accounting spreadsheets linked to deliverables.
4. **Invest in community health, not just growth**
   - Community is not a vanity metric. A small, engaged, and trusted group can be more powerful than a large, disengaged one.
5. **Be prepared for 24/7 accountability**
   - The global nature of Web3 means feedback – and criticism – can come at any time. Plan your communication schedule accordingly.





## Cheatsheet Web3 Do’s & Don’ts



| **Do’s**                                                     | **Don’ts**                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Deliver before overpromising – let working prototypes and verifiable actions speak for you. | Announce features or integrations before they are technically feasible. |
| Publish transparent treasury, funding, and deliverable reports – include TX hashes when possible. | Keep fund usage vague or “in progress” without updates.      |
| Engage directly in community spaces (Discord, Telegram, XSpaces) where your users already are. | Limit all communication to corporate channels like press releases or LinkedIn. |
| Use governance polls, open discussions, and community calls to collect input. | Ignore governance outcomes or community feedback that doesn’t match your plan. |
| Maintain consistent, steady communication even in bear markets. | Disappear during market downturns and only return when prices rise. |
| Highlight unique blockchain benefits while being honest about limitations. | Push blockchain hype without explaining real utility.        |
| Build cross-community relationships – collaborate with other projects even outside your chain. | Stay isolated in a single-ecosystem echo chamber.            |
| Address negative events quickly and factually to prevent FUD escalation. | Go silent or respond defensively when faced with criticism.  |

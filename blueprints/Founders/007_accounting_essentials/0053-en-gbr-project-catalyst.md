## Special Case Project Catalyst (probably a GbR)



> **Note:** This content is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Always consult a qualified professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.



From a purely tax perspective, **Project Catalyst** is a special case because the funds do not come from a traditional company or a governmental entity, but rather from the Cardano treasury or a decentralized network. (IOG, in this case, is more like an initiator and developer, not necessarily the “paying party” in the usual sense.)

In practice, however, it is often treated **as though you are providing a service or executing a project** for an (extra-European) entity. In Germany, the following typically applies to such income:

1. **Income Tax / Operating Income**  
   - If it represents a business activity (e.g., developing a software solution, prototype, marketing measures, etc.) and you get paid for it, these earnings must be reported as **business income** (for commercial/self-employed activities) or **other income** (for private activities).  
   - If you are already operating as a business person/freelancer, such Catalyst payments are included in your regular income-expense statement.

2. **Value Added Tax (VAT)**  
   - In cross-border services within or outside the EU, the question is: **“Where is the place of supply?”**  
   - As a rule, for B2B services provided to a client located in a third country (e.g., if IOG is based in the USA):  
     - The place of supply (simplified) is where the **service recipient** is established. This means **no German VAT applies** (no tax jurisdiction in Germany) if you truly deliver to a “company” located in a third country.  
   - Typically, you would note it in the German VAT return as a **non-taxable service** (line for services to third countries).  
   - If there is *no* clearly defined “client entity” and you simply receive “funding from the treasury,” the situation becomes even less transparent. In practice, it is often treated as a **non-taxable service**, but the tax office may ask questions.  
   - It is advisable to have a brief meeting with your tax advisor to determine what to do in your specific case (e.g., project scope, recipient details, etc.).

3. **Summary**  
   - For income tax purposes, it is **income** (commercial/self-employed or other).  
   - **VAT** usually does **not** arise in Germany if you assume that the “service recipient” is located in a **non-EU country** (third country) and it is a service.  
   - Decentralized projects like Cardano Catalyst are complicated because there is no “classic” client.  
   - In practice, it is often treated **like a cross-border B2B service** and thus **VAT-exempt** (or not taxable in Germany). However, you should clearly document **why** you believe this to be the case (e.g., details about IOG/Project Catalyst, project description, source of funding, etc.).



### Wallet Holder in Project Catalyst (Fiduciary Role)

In some Project Catalyst scenarios, one member of a group may hold the wallet in a **trustee (fiduciary) capacity**, especially when the wallet is **not** a multisig wallet. This situation can often lead to the formation of an **informal GbR (partnership)** under German law, since multiple parties are effectively engaging in a common project with a shared economic interest.

When a single individual holds the private keys and receives the funds, the **tax ownership** (i.e., who is considered the beneficial owner of these tokens or proceeds) must be clearly documented. If that individual is merely holding the wallet **on behalf of** the group (a fiduciary arrangement), then the underlying economic rights might belong to all parties involved - which in turn can trigger the requirements and obligations of a GbR or other partnership forms.

For **tax purposes**, the income or gains may need to be attributed to each participant proportionally, rather than to the wallet holder alone. Proper **documentation** and legal agreements (e.g., trustee or partnership contracts) are essential to demonstrate:

1. **Who ultimately owns the tokens**  
2. **How any rewards or profits** (e.g., from Catalyst funding, staking) are allocated among the participants  
3. **Whether or not** the wallet holder is simply a custodian acting on behalf of the group

This distinction matters greatly for determining each participant’s individual tax liability (e.g., private vs. commercial classification, allowances, etc.). If the arrangement **lacks** formal clarity, tax authorities might presume that all funds belong to the wallet holder - or, conversely, that an **informal partnership** has been created, making each member jointly responsible for declaration and taxation.

As a result, whenever multiple individuals collaborate on a Project Catalyst proposal, carefully **assessing the legal and tax structure** in advance (including potential trustee or partnership scenarios) is highly recommended. Always seek **professional advice** from a qualified tax advisor and/or attorney to ensure compliance and avoid unexpected tax consequences.



### Point in Time of Taxation / Sequence of Tax Events

1. **Initial Receipt (Group Wallet)**  
   - Typically, the tax office will regard **each participant** in the partnership/GbR as having received their proportional share of the funds **as soon as** the tokens flow into the jointly used (group) wallet.  
   - The relevant **market value** at that moment (date of _first_ inflow) is used to determine the taxable income for each partner.

2. **Subsequent Transfer (Individual Wallet)**  
   - If, after some time, the tokens are **moved** from the group wallet to each individual partner’s personal wallet, another taxable event **may** arise, depending on how the arrangement is structured.  
   - In many cases, this subsequent transfer may be viewed simply as a **distribution of assets** already deemed owned by each partner, rather than “new income.” However, if the tokens have **increased** in value between the first group receipt and the later transfer, the partnership (GbR) might be considered to have experienced an increase in value, potentially triggering further tax consequences on that appreciation (especially if there is a disposition, sale, or dissolution event within the partnership).

Because these details can be complex in practice, the final determination often depends on (a) whether or not the group continues to hold or stake the tokens collectively, (b) how and when the partnership recognizes gains or losses in its bookkeeping, and (c) the exact nature of the distribution (in-kind distribution vs. sale for fiat, etc.).



### Documentation is Key

If the arrangement **lacks** formal clarity, tax authorities might:

- Presume that all funds belong to the single wallet holder (leading to that person bearing the entire tax burden), or  
- Treat the group as an **informal GbR** with each member liable for their portion of income, plus any further gains or losses upon distribution.

Whenever multiple individuals collaborate on a Project Catalyst proposal (or any group-held crypto arrangement), carefully **assessing the legal and tax structure** in advance - including potential trustee or partnership scenarios - is highly recommended. Always seek **professional advice** from a qualified tax advisor and/or attorney to ensure compliance and avoid unexpected tax consequences.



### Example Calculations



#### Scenario 1: Equal Distribution

- **Scenario**: Three participants (A, B, C) collaborate on a Project Catalyst proposal. They agree (informally or via a simple contract) that each has an equal 1/3 stake in the funds.  
- On **01 January**, the group wallet (held by A as fiduciary) receives **9,000 ADA** at a market price of **€1.50** per ADA, giving a total value of **€13,500**.

1. **Initial Inflow**  
   - Each participant is considered (for tax purposes) to have **inwardly received** 3,000 ADA (their 1/3 share) at €1.50 = **€4,500**.  
   - This amount (e.g., €4,500 for each person) is typically recognized as **taxable income** in the year of receipt (depending on whether it’s considered commercial or other income).

2. **Subsequent Distribution**  
   - If on **01 February** the partnership decides to move each partner’s share of the ADA to personal wallets, and let’s say the ADA price is now **€2.00**, there may be an additional **unrealized gain** within the partnership from €1.50 to €2.00 per ADA if the tokens have effectively appreciated on the “partnership’s” balance sheet.  
   - Whether that triggers an immediate **tax event** again depends on the **legal and tax structure**. If the movement to individual wallets is treated purely as a distribution of already-owned assets, it may not trigger a brand-new inflow. However, if the partnership is deemed to have “disposed” or “exited” the position at the higher price (and the partners reacquire it individually), then some portion of the gain could be recognized and taxed at the partnership level (and allocated among the partners).



#### Scenario 2: Different Distribution

- **Scenario**: Three participants (A, B, C) collaborate on a Project Catalyst proposal. However, they do **not** have equal stakes. Instead, they agree on the following ratio for the 9,000 ADA they receive:

  - **A:** 4,000 ADA  
  - **B:** 3,000 ADA  
  - **C:** 2,000 ADA  

  The total (9,000 ADA) still arrives in a single group wallet (held by A). On **01 January**, the market price is **€1.50** per ADA, so the total value is **€13,500**.

1. **Initial Inflow**  
   - For tax purposes, each participant is considered to have **inwardly received** their respective share at the moment it arrives in the group wallet:  
     - A: 4,000 ADA → €6,000  
     - B: 3,000 ADA → €4,500  
     - C: 2,000 ADA → €3,000  
   - These amounts (e.g., €6,000 for A, €4,500 for B, €3,000 for C) would typically be recognized as **taxable income** for each individual in the year of receipt.

2. **Subsequent Distribution**  
   - Suppose on **01 February**, the partnership decides to distribute the ADA to each partner’s personal wallet, and by then the market price is **€2.00** per ADA.  
   - The tokens, now worth:  
     - A: 4,000 ADA → €8,000  
     - B: 3,000 ADA → €6,000  
     - C: 2,000 ADA → €4,000  
   - Whether a further taxable event occurs at distribution depends again on whether the partnership is seen as “disposing” assets. If the partnership is effectively transferring assets already owned by each participant, the distribution may not trigger additional income. However, if the transfer is seen as a **realization** of gains by the partnership (e.g., a sale or dissolution event), there may be a tax event attributed to that appreciation.  
   - In practice, clear documentation - showing that each partner already **owned** their share as of 01 January - can support the view that this is simply a transfer of property already allocated to each individual.

3. #### Scenario 3: Changing Allocations After Initial Receipt

   - **Scenario**: Three participants (A, B, C) initially agree on a distribution of **9,000 ADA** as follows:  
     - **A:** 50%  
     - **B:** 30%  
     - **C:** 20%  

     However, one month after the initial inflow, they decide to adjust the allocation to:  
     - **A:** 40%  
     - **B:** 40%  
     - **C:** 20%  

     This adjustment happens **before** any ADA is transferred out to individual wallets.

   1. **Initial Inflow**  
      - On **01 January**, the wallet receives 9,000 ADA at €1.50 (total €13,500). A, B, and C are viewed as receiving, respectively:  
        - A: 4,500 ADA (50%) → €6,750  
        - B: 2,700 ADA (30%) → €4,050  
        - C: 1,800 ADA (20%) → €2,700  

   2. **Midway Re-Allocation**  
      - On **01 February** - still no distribution to personal wallets has occurred - they decide to modify the shares so that A and B both hold 40%, while C remains at 20%.  
      - Depending on how this "change in allocation" is treated legally, it may create a partial "sale" or "exchange" of ADA interests among A, B, and C inside the partnership. In other words, B gains an extra 10%, while A loses 10%.  
      - If the ADA price on 01 February is, for example, €2.00, then the "exchange" in beneficial ownership could be seen as happening at the new price, possibly generating a realized gain or other tax implications for A (who gives up some of his share) and B (who acquires more).

   3. **Final Distribution**  
      - If, on **01 March**, they finally transfer the tokens to individual wallets, each participant's final share is now:  
        - A: 40% of 9,000 ADA = 3,600 ADA  
        - B: 40% of 9,000 ADA = 3,600 ADA  
        - C: 20% of 9,000 ADA = 1,800 ADA  
      - Exactly how and when the re-allocation is recognized for tax purposes can be complex and may require professional advice. Detailed documentation is essential to show how the partnership recognized or accounted for the shift in ownership.

   > **Takeaway:** If allocations change **after** the initial inflow, you may have additional tax events. Such changes should be carefully documented and assessed for their potential impact on tax liability.

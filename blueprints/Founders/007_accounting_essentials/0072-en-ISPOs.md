## Initial Stakepool Offering (ISPO)

The **principle of inflow** (“Zuflussprinzip”) is an important aspect of ISPOs (Initial Stake Pool Offerings). If the rewards initially remain “on the platform” and must be claimed manually, one can argue that the inflow for the delegator does not occur until the moment of claiming. Whenever the delegator actively decides whether they even want the tokens, that is effectively the point at which they gain actual “control” over them—and, from a tax perspective, that is typically deemed the point of inflow.

**From the perspective of the ISPO provider:**

- If there is no automated payout and the delegator has to claim manually, this can have two potential advantages:
  1. **Regulatory**: You could argue that there is no automated financial transaction (see BaFin), which may reduce certain licensing requirements.
  2. Depending on the specifics of the custody process, you might be considered a custodian if the ISPO platform holds tokens that do not belong to the ISPO provider itself.
- Especially if these are **third-party** tokens (i.e., not the provider’s own token), the question quickly arises as to whether the provider requires a **license** under the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz, KWG) or under the legislation covering crypto custody businesses (e.g., “Krypto-Verwahrgeschäft”).

### When does crypto custody apply?

- As soon as the assets of third parties (in this case, delegators) are held and those users do not have full control over their private keys, this might—depending on the specifics of the individual case—constitute a **custody service requiring a license**.
- However, if it is only the ISPO provider’s own token (for example, coming from a smart contract), the situation may be less critical depending on the structure (keywords: “self-custody” vs. “custodied assets”).

### Tax-related note on inflow

- In case of doubt, the tax authorities will always ask: “Did you (the delegator) already have the ability to freely dispose of the tokens at some earlier point in time?”
  - **Yes?** Then the tax office may consider that the inflow occurred at the time when the tokens were “theoretically claimable.”
  - **No?** If the tokens only actually move into your own wallet upon manual claiming, then the inflow date is the date of the claim.

Hence, **proper documentation** (recording exactly when the rewards were allocated, when tokens could be claimed, etc.) is key to making a credible argument to the tax authorities as to when the actual inflow occurred.

In particular, regarding potential topics related to financial supervisory authorities (MiCA, crypto custody, licensing requirements) and the precise determination of the tax inflow date, you should consult a **tax advisor** or **legal expert specializing in financial supervisory law** on a case-by-case basis.

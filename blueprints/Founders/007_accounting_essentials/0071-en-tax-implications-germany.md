## Definitions and Preliminary Notes

### **Definitions and Preliminary Notes**

1. **Holding Period (1 year)**: Applies only to **private** cryptocurrencies. In the case of commercial use, the tax-free disposal after one year is no longer available.

2. **Allowance (€256)** generally applies to **private** staking/mining activities. Once an activity is classified as commercial, this allowance no longer applies.

3. **Tax Transparency** means that the profits and losses of the company appear directly in the tax return of the **shareholders** or owners (transparent taxation). With non-transparent taxation, profits are first taxed at the company level.

4. **Separation of Private and Commercial Allowances**  
   The **€256 allowance** (per year) normally applies to **private** staking/mining income. However, once an activity is classified as commercial (e.g., operating a staking pool on an ongoing basis), **this allowance is void**. For the same individual (sole proprietor or partner), it is often difficult to clearly distinguish between private and business portions. Therefore, accurate **bookkeeping** and **documentation** are absolutely necessary to prove during a tax audit which rewards are private and which are commercial.

5. **Double Taxation for Corporations**: Profits are taxed at the corporate level (corporate income tax + trade tax). When distributed to shareholders, **withholding tax** (25% + solidarity surcharge + possibly church tax) also applies.

6. **Holding Models**  
   **Two-tier UGs or GmbHs** can lead to tax advantages upon distributions. Example: If a holding company (parent) holds shares in an operational UG/GmbH, distributions to the parent company can be **partially** tax-exempt (see § 8b KStG). However, a subsequent distribution to private individuals is again subject to withholding tax. Such arrangements should **always** be planned with professional **tax advice**.

7. **NFT Sales**:

   - *Private*: Occasional sales of NFTs you hold personally can, in some cases, be subject to the same speculative holding periods as other private crypto assets (one year).
   - *Commercial*: Those who regularly mint and sell NFTs (e.g., as an artist with sustained intent to earn a profit) generally realize commercial income.

8. **Compensation in ADA (or other tokens)**:

   - If a service (e.g., consulting, software development) is paid in crypto, from a tax perspective it is **treated the same as payment in fiat**.
   - The value at receipt is the **market price** at the time of crediting and is considered business income (income tax/corporate income tax + possibly VAT).

## Cheatsheet

Below is a **condensed overview** of the key points. Detailed explanations and examples can be found in the sections below.

### Overview Table

The most common legal forms can be grouped into three main categories:

1. **Sole Proprietorship**  
2. **Partnerships** (GbR, OHG, KG)  
3. **Corporations** (UG/GmbH)

| **Criterion**                               | **Sole Proprietorship**                                      | **Partnership** (GbR, OHG, KG)                               | **Corporation** (UG/GmbH)                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tax Transparency**                        | Profits/losses are included directly in the owner’s personal income tax (no separate legal entity). | Transparent: profits/losses are allocated to the partners and taxed individually. | Non-transparent: The corporation pays corporate tax and trade tax. Distributions to shareholders are additionally subject to withholding tax. |
| **Staking/Mining Rewards**                  | - **Up to €256/year** (private) may be tax-free.<br>- If classified as commercial (e.g., ongoing staking), the allowance is void.<br>- Taxed at the market rate when received. | - Possibly a €256 allowance per partner (only with **private** classification).<br>- Often commercial, hence fully taxable.<br>- Taxed at market value upon receipt & allocated among partners. | - No allowance (all income is taxable).<br>- Crypto holdings belong to the corporation’s business assets.<br>- Ongoing corporate and trade tax on profits. |
| **Holding Period (1 year)**                 | Only relevant for **private** coins (speculative period). Once they are in business assets, it does not apply. | If there is a truly “private” sphere for the partners, the 1-year period may apply. Any crypto in business assets is continuously taxable. | **No** tax-free sale after one year. Disposal gains are always subject to corporate income tax. |
| **Trade Tax**                               | - Sole proprietors operating sustainably (e.g., staking pool) may owe trade tax.<br>- Partial allowance of €24,500 may apply. | - GbR/OHG/KG are typically commercial. Utilizing the trade tax allowance can reduce trade tax.<br>- Trade tax is apportioned to the partners; some of it can be offset against personal income tax. | - Corporations regularly pay trade tax (municipal rate varies).<br>- No allowance as with sole proprietors/partnerships. |
| **Double Taxation** (Entity & Shareholders) | No “double” taxation: all is taxed once in the individual’s **income tax**. | - Profits pass through to the partners (income tax).<br>- A second layer occurs only in certain situations (e.g., special arrangements for limited partners). | Yes, two levels:<br>1. **Company level**: Corporate tax + trade tax<br>2. **Shareholder level**: Withholding tax on dividends. |
| **Separating Private and Business**         | - Necessary so the tax authorities can see which coins/income are commercial vs. private. | - Very important to maintain separate private and business wallets/accounts.<br>- Even with a GbR, you should have a dedicated “GbR account.” | - Strict separation since the corporation is a separate legal entity (its own wallet, bank account). |
| **Recommendations**                         | - If unsure (hobby vs. commercial), consult a tax advisor<br>- Keep thorough documentation of all inflows/outflows | - Draft a partnership agreement (GbR, OHG, KG), define the business purpose<br>- Separate private and partnership-owned assets<br>- Observe mandatory tax record-keeping | - Double-entry bookkeeping, detailed documentation of all crypto transactions<br>- Plan for tax prepayments & distributions early (possibly use a holding structure) |

### Short Conclusion

- **Sole Proprietorship**  
  - Simpler to manage, but if classified as commercial, trade tax can apply.  
  - The €256 allowance only applies to genuinely **private** rewards (no professional infrastructure).

- **Partnerships** (GbR, OHG, KG)  
  - **Tax transparent**: profits are allocated directly to the partners.  
  - Often commercial, negating the private allowance.  
  - Clear separation between private and business assets is crucial.

- **Corporations** (UG, GmbH)  
  - **Two tax levels**: 1) at the company level (corporate + trade tax), 2) at the shareholder level (withholding tax on distributions).  
  - No 1-year holding period or allowance.  
  - Limited liability can be advantageous for larger projects.

## 1. Separation of Private and Business Accounts

For tax classification, it is crucial to strictly separate private and business wallets (and fiat accounts). Without this separation, you risk problems during audits and potential estimated additions to your taxable income.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | Clear delineation is required. The tax office must be able to distinguish which transactions are private and which are business-related. | Max opens a dedicated business account and a separate wallet solely for his staking business. |
| **GbR**             | The GbR should have its own account (and possibly its own wallet) to avoid conflicts with partners’ private accounts. | Two friends form a GbR and handle all transactions via a “GbR account.” Note: A GbR can also form informally as soon as you act together. |
| **OHG**             | Similar to a GbR but entered in the commercial register. Typically commercial, so keeping accounts/wallets separate is very important. | An OHG with three partners uses a separate business account and a corporate wallet for all crypto transactions. |
| **KG**              | Similar to an OHG. Additionally, you must clarify which contributions come from general partners and which come from limited partners. | In a KG, the general partners keep their private wallets strictly separate from the KG wallet so that it’s clear which rewards belong to the KG. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | Strict separation, as the corporation is its own legal entity. | A GmbH stores all staking rewards in a clearly separate company wallet. The shareholders do not conduct any private transactions through this wallet. |

---

## 2. Tax Transparency

“Tax transparency” means that profits/losses are allocated directly to the shareholders or owners and appear in their **personal income tax** returns. In non-transparent forms (corporations), **the company** is taxed first.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | Profits and losses go directly into the owner’s personal income tax return. | Max runs a validator node as a sole proprietor, earning €10,000, which goes on his personal tax return. |
| **GbR**             | Transparent taxation: the GbR’s profits are allocated among the partners, each taxed individually. | Two friends run a GbR that earns €50,000. Each partner’s share (e.g., €25,000) appears in their personal income tax return, based on the partnership agreement. |
| **OHG**             | Like a GbR, but it’s a commercial partnership in the commercial register. Similarly transparent: profits go to the partners directly. | An OHG runs a staking pool and makes €100,000. It’s allocated (e.g., 40/30/30), and each partner pays personal income tax on their share. |
| **KG**              | Also tax transparent: profits are divided between general partners (full liability) and limited partners (limited liability). General partners are taxed like sole proprietors. | A KG earns €80,000. Suppose general partners get €60,000 (taxed like sole proprietors) and limited partners get €20,000 (also declared in their personal returns). |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | Non-transparent: The entity is taxed on its corporate income (corporate and trade tax). If dividends are paid out, shareholders also pay withholding tax. | A GmbH makes €200,000 in profit and pays corporate and trade tax. When dividends are distributed to the shareholders, an additional 25% withholding tax may apply. |

## 3. Taxation of Staking Rewards

Staking rewards (and likewise mining rewards) are typically taxed **at their market value** when they are **received**.

- A **private** classification may allow a €256 allowance.  
- A **commercial** classification usually negates that allowance.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | Staking rewards are income at the moment received. Up to €256 can be exempt if it’s purely private. If the activity becomes commercial, the allowance doesn’t apply. | On January 1, 2024, Max gets 5 ADA (value €1 each = €5). If total annual rewards stay below €256, they’re tax-free; if he exceeds €256, all is taxed. |
| **GbR**             | Rewards are allocated among the partners, valued at receipt. Each partner may have a €256 allowance if considered private income. | Two GbR partners run a staking pool, earning 100 ADA at €2 each = €200. Allocated 50/50, that’s €100 per partner. |
| **OHG**             | Similar to GbR, but as a commercial partnership, it usually won’t qualify for the €256 private allowance. | An OHG gets 500 ADA monthly. These are valued at market rate and allocated among partners. As it’s likely commercial, the private allowance typically doesn’t apply. |
| **KG**              | Similar to an OHG, but profits are split between general and limited partners. Usually commercial, so no allowance. | A KG receives 300 ADA monthly. General partners pay tax like sole proprietors; limited partners pay on their distribution. Overall, it’s commercial. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | No allowance, since earnings are business income, subject to corporate and trade tax on an ongoing basis. | A GmbH runs a validator node, receiving 500 ADA monthly. On each payment date, the market rate is recorded and taxed—no holding period or allowance. |

## 4. Holding Period for Tax Exemption

The **one-year holding period** for private crypto disposals generally **does not** apply if the tokens are **commercial** or held as business assets.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | For purely private coins, a 1-year holding period can make gains tax-free. Once the coins are in business assets, this advantage is lost. | Max holds 1,000 ADA privately for over a year and sells them tax-free. If he transfers them into his business, any disposal becomes commercial. |
| **GbR**             | A GbR itself doesn’t benefit from a private holding period. Only coins **not** contributed to the GbR remain private. | Two partners each have private ADA plus the GbR wallet. Disposals from the GbR wallet are always business disposals. |
| **OHG**             | An OHG is typically commercial, so the 1-year holding period does not apply to OHG-held assets. | An OHG holds 10,000 ADA in business assets. Even after a year, any sale is taxable. |
| **KG**              | Similar to an OHG, with general and limited partners. If coins are in the KG’s business assets, they do not benefit from the 1-year exemption. | A KG buys 5,000 ADA and holds for two years. Gains remain taxable, as they are in business assets. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | Corporations can never use the 1-year rule; sales are always subject to corporate tax. | A GmbH buys ADA, sells after two years for a gain, and pays corporate and trade tax. |

---

## 5. Contribution of Private Tokens to the Business

If private coins are contributed to business assets, they lose their **private** character; any potential holding-period benefits and private-income rules may no longer apply.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | There’s no real “contribution” since private and business assets belong to the same person. Once tokens are used for business, they’re business assets. | Max uses the ADA he previously held privately for his commercial staking. Consequently, they become part of his business assets. |
| **GbR**             | Tokens may be contributed as capital to the GbR. This changes them from private to GbR assets, losing private holding-period benefits. | Two partners decide to contribute ADA they previously held privately to the GbR. From that point on, those tokens are clearly business assets. |
| **OHG**             | Similar to a GbR but typically commercial. The contribution is treated as a capital deposit. | One partner contributes 2,000 ADA he previously owned privately to the OHG, which then become part of the OHG’s business assets. |
| **KG**              | Both general and limited partners can make contributions. Anything contributed belongs to the partnership’s assets. | A limited partner contributes 1,000 ADA he held privately. From now on, they are part of the KG’s assets. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | For corporations, contributed tokens are considered non-cash contributions (possibly requiring valuation). They then become corporate assets, fully taxable upon sale. | A GmbH accepts a non-cash contribution of 10,000 ADA. Those ADA belong to the GmbH and are taxable upon disposal or use (e.g., staking). |

---

## 6. Tax Burden

Depending on the legal form, **income tax**, **corporate tax**, and/or **trade tax** may apply. In partnerships (GbR, OHG, KG), profits are allocated to the partners, while corporations themselves pay taxes at the company level.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | Income tax at the individual rate + possibly trade tax (depending on commercial status and allowances). | Max earns €12,000 from crypto staking and pays, for example, 30% in personal income tax. |
| **GbR**             | Profits are allocated among the partners and taxed in their personal returns. If the business is classified as commercial, trade tax is due and may be prorated to the partners. | Two partners split €60,000 50/50, each declaring €30,000 on their personal returns. |
| **OHG**             | Typically a commercial business (registered partnership), so trade tax applies. The remaining profit is then allocated to each partner’s income tax return. | Three partners generate €90,000 in profits (commercial). Each is taxed on their share as personal income. |
| **KG**              | General partners are taxed like sole proprietors, limited partners depending on their share. The KG itself is subject to trade tax, passed through to the partners. | A general partner gets €40,000 in profit, a limited partner €20,000. Each is taxed on their share personally. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | Corporate tax (15%) + trade tax. A second layer: withholding tax (25% + solidarity surcharge + possibly church tax) on dividends to shareholders. | A GmbH earns €100,000. After taxes, say €70,000 remain. If dividends are paid out, a 25% withholding tax (+Soli + possibly church tax) applies. |

---

## 7. Allowance for Private Staking Rewards

The €256 allowance applies **only** to private staking/mining income. Commercial income is not eligible. Frequently, an activity is deemed commercial if it’s sustained and designed for profit, which is often the case with staking/mining.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | Up to €256 can be tax-free if it’s genuinely **private**. If it’s run as a commercial operation, the allowance no longer applies. | Max receives €250 in rewards—no tax. If he earns €270, the entire €270 is taxable. |
| **GbR**             | Each partner can have up to €256 if truly “private.” In many cases, the GbR is commercial (e.g., a staking pool), so the allowance is often moot. | Two partners collectively earn €500, which is €250 each. If both remain below €256, no tax. With €600, the full amount becomes taxable after allocation. |
| **OHG**             | Typically commercial (registered partnership), so the allowance generally does not apply. | An OHG does mining, earning €300. Because it’s commercial, the entire €300 is taxable (allocated to partners). |
| **KG**              | General partners might potentially claim €256 if truly private, but in practice, the activity is usually commercial, making the allowance irrelevant. | A general partner and a limited partner share €400 from staking. If it’s a commercial KG, no allowance applies. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | No allowance—every receipt is immediately taxable at the corporate level. | A GmbH earns €200 from staking. It must report the full €200 as operating income (corporate + trade tax). |

---

## 8. Relevance of the Business Purpose

Whether crypto staking/mining is considered private or commercial depends heavily on the specific **business purpose**. With sustained profit intent, professional infrastructure, etc., a commercial classification is likely.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | The business purpose determines if it’s a “private hobby” or a “commercial activity.” Occasional staking might still be private, but a professional service is more likely to be commercial. | Max stakes 500 ADA yearly just as a hobby—no trade tax. If he sets up a professional platform, it may be deemed a commercial business. |
| **GbR**             | The GbR must define its business purpose. For crypto activities like running a staking pool, a commercial registration is often required due to ongoing profit generation. | A GbR develops a staking platform. In most cases, this is deemed commercial; all earnings are commercial income. |
| **OHG**             | By definition, an OHG is a commercial partnership (entered in the commercial register). | An OHG with 3 partners runs a mining farm. They’re clearly operating a commercial business. |
| **KG**              | General partners typically run the operational business (commercial), limited partners usually provide capital. Nonetheless, the entire arrangement can be commercial. | A KG operates a staking node. The general partners are active in the business, limited partners provide capital. All income is commercial. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | Corporations (UG, GmbH) are usually considered commercial and pay corporate and trade tax. | A GmbH offers a staking service—commercial income.           |

---

## 9. Recommended Actions

Regardless of the legal form: **consult a tax advisor**, maintain a clear separation of accounts, keep proper **bookkeeping**, possibly register a business depending on scale and purpose.

| **Legal Form**      | **Regulation / Key Points**                                  | **Practical Example**                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sole Proprietor** | Strictly separate private and business assets. If uncertain about hobby vs. commercial status, seek tax advice. | Max invests in bookkeeping software and documents all staking inflows and outflows to be prepared for a tax audit. |
| **GbR**             | Draft a GbR agreement, define the business purpose, clarify contributions, and ensure separation of accounts. If you run a professional staking pool, a commercial registration is likely required. | Two partners consult a tax firm before officially launching their staking pool. |
| **OHG**             | Requires commercial registration, double-entry bookkeeping under the German Commercial Code (HGB), and trade tax obligations. Invest in professional accounting. | Three partners form an OHG to run a mining farm. They immediately hire a tax advisor for ongoing financial accounting. |
| **KG**              | Clearly outline roles in the partnership agreement (general vs. limited partners). Clarify the tax treatment of limited partners, as it may be commercially influenced. | In a KG, one general partner handles operations, and limited partners only invest capital. All transactions go through a dedicated KG account. |
| **UG/GmbH (Corp.)** | Corporate accounting (double-entry), corporate tax, trade tax. Dividend distributions incur withholding tax (25% + solidarity surcharge + possibly church tax). Require professional advice. | A GmbH consults a tax advisor right away to properly record all mining/staking revenue and calculate corporate and trade tax. |

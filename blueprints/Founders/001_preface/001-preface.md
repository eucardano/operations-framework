## Introduction

This is not about conspiracy theories but a practical outline of how the journey as a founder could look.  

We sincerely hope this basic script will help you leverage our knowledge for your decision-making.  
Special thanks go to the [Cardano Community, which voted for us in Cardano Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/112747) to fund our work here.  

We will cover essential aspects of your legal duties, how to plan your marketing, simple scripts to improve your workflow, and our experiences from building a community.  

We assume that you want to work in the realms of blockchain, crypto, and SSI, so weâ€™ll add some of that spice too. ðŸ˜Š  
However, most â€“ if not all â€“ of the knowledge and rules stem from Web2, traditional markets, or interactions with them, making this guide a useful compass for both Web2 and Web3 pioneers.  

We hope to find many contributors along the way to improve and expand upon the knowledge provided.  

This is also why we have initiated the [ECC Country Hubs](https://github.com/eucardano/operations-framework/blob/main/reports/f11/assets/f11.m2.chws-statement.md) â€“ a series of live events that weâ€™re [sponsoring with the help of our Cardano Catalyst funds](https://github.com/eucardano/operations-framework/blob/main/countryhubs/event-params.md).
